		# Flexbox

Is about laying out things on a single axis

- as a row
- as a column

## Apply Flexbox

Apply `flexbox` to an element and it will change how its children behave. The item itself will still behave like a block level element. Below you see the CSS we apply

```css
.flex-container {
	display: flex;
}
li {
	margin: 0 10px;
}
```

to this HTML.

```html
<nav>
	<ul class="flex-container">
		<li>home</li>
		<li>about</li>
		<li>projects</li>
	</ul>
</nav>
```

The result can be seen below.

<div class="example">
	<Nav title="Flexbox" />
</div>

## Flexbox Directions

The `flex-direction` controls on which axis the children will be laid out. By default we lay them out in a `row`. That means from left to right. This sets also the primary axis to go from the left to the right. But we can change this. If we want it to go from top to bottom we can set `flex-direction: column`. From right to left we can set `flex-direction: row-reverse`. From bottom to top we can set `flex-direction: column-reverse`. With each of these changes the primary axis also changes.

### Flex Direction Row

<SvgFlexdirectionRow isFlexDirectionRow={true} />

### Flex Direction Column

<SvgFlexdirectionRow isFlexDirectionRow={false} />

## Flexbox Alignment

### Primary Axis

For each of the axis we have properties to control the alignment. If we want to control the alignment on the primary axis we use the `justify-content` property. This property can take the following values (there are more but these are the most common ones, see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content) for more):

- `flex-start` (default)
- `flex-end`
- `center`
- `space-between`
- `space-around`
- `space-evenly`

Below you see how these values affect the alignment of the children.

<Alignment
	title="justify-content: flex-start"
	className="justify-content-start"
/>

<Alignment title="justify-content: flex-end" className="justify-content-end" />

<Alignment title="justify-content: center" className="justify-content-center" />

<Alignment
	title="justify-content: space-between"
	className="justify-content-space-between"
/>

<Alignment
	title="justify-content: space-around"
	className="justify-content-space-around"
/>

<Alignment
	title="justify-content: space-evenly"
	className="justify-content-space-evenly"
/>

### Cross Axis

To control the alignment on the cross axis we use the `align-items` property. This property can take the following values (there are more but these are the most common ones, see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items) for more):

- `flex-start`
- `flex-end`
- `center`
- `stretch` (default)
- `baseline`

<Alignment
	title="align-items: stretch"
	className="justify-content-center"
	alignItems="align-items-stretch"
/>
<Alignment
	title="align-items: flex-start"
	className="justify-content-center"
	alignItems="align-items-start"
/>

<Alignment
	title="align-items: baseline"
	className="justify-content-center"
	alignItems="align-items-baseline"
/>

<Alignment
	title="align-items: center"
	className="justify-content-center"
	alignItems="align-items-center"
/>
<Alignment
	title="align-items: flex-end"
	className="justify-content-center"
	alignItems="align-items-end"
/>

### Cross Axis Override

What if we want an item on the cross axis not to stretch or align itself to the end? Since we are not the first ones with this idea, flexbox has a property for that. The `align-self`. This overrides the `align-items` property for the individual item.
The values are the same as for `align-items`. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self) for more information.

<Alignment
	title="align-self: flex-end"
	className="justify-content-center"
	alignItems="align-items-start"
	alignSelf="align-self-end"
	itemSelector={1}
/>

<Note text="We wont write out all combinations here since you can see the effect in the example for the cross-axis alignment." />

## Growing and Shrinking Items

<h2>flex-grow</h2>
<p>
	The property <code>flex-grow</code> can be used to set which fraction of the
	existing space an element can occupy (as long as there is enough space). From
	MDN
</p>

<blockquote>
	For example, if four 100px flex items are in a 700px container and the flex
	items have flex-grow factors of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the total main
	size of the three items is 400px, meaning there is 300px of positive free
	space to be distributed. There are a total of 6 grow factors (3 + 2 + 1),
	therefore each grow factor is equal to 50px ((300px / 6 ). Each flex item is
	given an amount of positive free space equal to this amount multiplied by its
	flex-grow value â€” so 0, 50px, 100px, and 150px respectively. The total flex
	item sizes are therefore 100px, 150px, 200px, and 250px respectively.
</blockquote>
<h3>Example Flex Grow</h3>
<p>
	In the example below we set the <code>flex-basis </code> for each item to
	100px and the <code>flex-grow</code> factor to 3,2,1 and 0.
</p>

<Grow />

<h2>flex-shrink</h2>
<p>
	The property <code>flex-shrink</code> defines in which proportion an element
	should shrink relative to all other flex items in the container.
</p>

<h3>Example Flex Shrink</h3>
<p>
	In the example below we set the <code>flex-basis </code> for each item to
	300px and the <code>flex-shrink</code> factor to 4,3,2 and 1.
</p>

<Shrink />

## The `flex` Shorthand

TBD.

## Wrapping Items

If we don't have enough space available flexbox allows us to define a the property `flex-wrap` to tell the items to wrap.

### Flex Wrap Example

In the example below we apply `flex-wrap: wrap;` to the container. Since all the items have a `flex-basis` of `256px` they wrap around.

<Wrap />

## Space between items (`gap`)

To control the space between items we can use margin, but flexbox comes with its own property `gap`. This property can take any CSS length value.

### Gap Example

In the example below we apply `gap: 16px;` and `justify-content: center;` to the container.

<Gap />
